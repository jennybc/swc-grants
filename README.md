- Text that can be adapted and inserted into grant applications, i.e. to request financial support a workshop or two or three. Contact info for individuals willing to look over.

- Upcoming/ongoing grant opportunities of potential relevance to SWC, plus who is currently working on them or might be interested in working on them.

  - [NSERC CREATE](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/grants-subs/CREATE-FONCER_eng.asp) (Canada) "supports the training of teams of highly qualified students and postdoctoral fellows".
    - SWC could *partner* with CREATE programs to deliver a specific kind of enhanced training
    - explicit attention must be paid to training outside the discipline's normal technical skills; SWC-type skills could potentially meet that objective
    - "The training initiative should be focused on providing a __value-added experience__ to the university training environment to better prepare research trainees for their future careers in industry, government or academia."
    - "... raise the standard for best practices in research training and development of professional skills"
    - $150K - $300K per annum for up to 6 years; 80% must go to student stipends; remaining 20% can go to various things including "short-term training related to professional skill development"
    - UBC's Statistical Consulting and Research Lab has delivered R/stats/SWC-ish workshops for at least one NSERC CREATE already
    - program has been going on since 2009 and ongoing + new CREATEs are potential SWC partners
